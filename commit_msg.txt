Release SEDA v1.3: The Standardized Extension Update

This version introduces 'Extension Mandating' in the packer. The user 
is now only responsible for the base name; the tool automatically 
appends the correct subtype extension based on the provided flags.

Summary of Changes:
1. Updated `tools/seda_packer.py`:
   - Implemented `mandate_extension()` logic.
   - Strips user-provided extensions and re-appends based on flags:
     - [Docstring] + [Post-Install] -> .smartpatch.seda
     - [Docstring] Only -> .commit.seda
     - [Post-Install] Only -> .construct.seda
     - [Neither] -> .seda

2. Updated `README.md` & `AGENTS.md`:
   - Documented the mandated naming convention.
   - Refined instructions for protocol compliance.
