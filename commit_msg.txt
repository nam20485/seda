feat: introduce SEDA-Vault (Type 2) Encryption Support (Hotfix)

This Smart Patch upgrades the SEDA protocol to v1.5, introducing Type 2 support.
Type 2 archives are "Vault" files: encrypted archives that require a password to unpack.

Features:
- New `--vault` flag in `seda_packer.py`.
- Generates files with `.vault.seda` extension.
- Implements dependency-free encryption (PBKDF2 key derivation + XOR stream cipher).
- Runtime password prompt.

Fixes:
- Forces UTF-8 encoding in validation scripts to prevent Windows 'charmap' errors.

Post-Install:
- Runs validation.
- Commits changes to the repo.
